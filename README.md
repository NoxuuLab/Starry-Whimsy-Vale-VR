# VirtualReality

## Overview

This project is a Virtual Reality (VR) scene built with [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/), a web framework for building VR experiences. The scene is set in a serene, otherworldly landscape under a starry sky. It features animated models like fluffy clouds, a mysterious "spooky" entity, and dynamic shooting stars that streak across the heavens.

 This project was created for the course on **Réalité virtuelle et augmentée**, run by [Isaac Pante](https://github.com/ipante) at the [University of Lausanne](https://www.unil.ch/) (UNIL).

## Features

- **Dynamic Shooting Stars**: Utilizes JavaScript to create random shooting stars that animate across the sky.
- **Interactive Sound**: Clicking on the "spooky" entity toggles ambient sounds.
- **Random Model Generation**: Randomly placed models within the scene, each with its own unique rotation animation.
- **Ambient Lighting**: A spot light and ambient light are used to set the mood of the scene.
- **Responsive Design**: Compatible with VR headsets and standard browsers, scaling across various devices.
